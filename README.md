# PQC Blockchain - Quantum-Resistant Blockchain Platform

A post-quantum cryptographic blockchain with built-in services, revenue generation, and quantum-resistant security.



- Quantum-Resistant Security**: CRYSTALS-Dilithium signatures (NIST approved)
- High Performance**: 1,773 TPS capability
- Built-in Revenue System**: Developer fees on all transactions
- Token Creation: Deploy quantum-safe tokens 
- Storage Service**: Decentralized file storage
- Document Verification**: On-chain proof system


Why This Matters

- Bitcoin and Ethereum use ECDSA (breakable by quantum computers)
- $2.7 trillion crypto market at risk
- This blockchain is quantum-safe with revenue generation built-in
- Multiple utility services beyond just transactions
