# PQC Blockchain - Quantum-Resistant Future

A quantum-resistant blockchain built from scratch, designed to withstand attacks from quantum computers.

## Features
- 🔐 Quantum-resistant cryptography (Dilithium/Falcon ready)
- ⛏️ Proof of Work consensus
- 💰 Native QRC token
- 📊 Balance tracking
- 🔗 Multi-block chain validation

## Why This Matters
- Bitcoin and Ethereum use ECDSA (breakable by quantum computers)
- $2.7 trillion crypto market at risk
- This blockchain is built quantum-safe from day one

## Quick Start
```bash
python pqc_demo.py
